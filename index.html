		<h2 >Introduction</h2>
		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) consists of a variety of technologies that combine data, algorithms and computer
			technology. As advances in computing power and the availability of data have increased, so too have
			expectations regarding AI’s possibilities in various areas of society. It is currently recognised that as
			much as 30% of the world’s stored data is produced by the healthcare sector.1 These data include biobanks,
			medical health records and observational studies. However, this ‘data-rich’ sector does not currently
			explore and analyse data to the full potential. Machine Learning (ML) and automatic text processing
			technologies can support the operations and efficiency of our healthcare sector in numerous ways: a) by
			improving the efficiencies and operations within clinical laboratories, thus improving patient management
			and clinical outcomes; b) by offering solutions for more efficient data management to develop better
			screening mechanisms to analyse clinical data and diagnose disease; c) by performing complex simulations
			that can assess the effectiveness of new medicines based on clinical research data.
		</p><br>
		<p>There has as yet been very little research into the use of AI applications for patients or healthy citizens,
			although the technology may allow for a much more individual and person-centred approach. For example, by
			combining ubiquitous data with user-generated and publicly available data, AI algorithms can guide and
			inform citizens about risk modifying behaviors in an appropriate context. Context can be defined as “any
			information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or
			object that is considered relevant for the interaction between a user and an application, including the user
			and applications themselves.” This definition shows the importance of which information is relevant or not
			in a context-aware architecture. A system is context-aware if it uses context to provide relevant
			information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the user’s task. This defintion shows
			that a context-aware architecture can change its behaviour and send relevant information according to the
			context. Context information can be divided into three main axes: a) Social awareness: e.g., ‘where a person
			is’, ‘activity in which a person is engaged on’, ‘self- reported status’; b) Spatial awareness: e.g., ’what
			kind of operation is taking place’, ’level of activity’, ’status of operation and people present in the
			room’; c) Temporal awareness: e.g., ’past activities’, ’present and future activities’ that is significant
			for a person. </p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The goal of this workshop is to provide a unique platform to bring together researchers and practitioners in
			healthcare informatics working with health-related data especially textual data, and facilitate close
			interaction among students, scholars, and industry professionals on eHealth language processing tasks. In
			particular,<strong> we are interested in works that advance state-of-the-art NLP and ML techniques for
				eHealth domains by incorpo-rating more contextual knowledge in order to make models explainable,
				trustable and robust in changing situations.</strong>

		<h3 >Submission Topics</h3>
		<p>We are interested in research on novel approaches, works in progress, comparative analyses of tools, and
			advancing state-of-the-art work in eHealth NLP methods, tools, and applications. Relevant topics for the
			workshop include, but are not limited to, the following areas: </p>
		<br>
		<p>• Modelling of healthcare text in classical NLP tasks (tagging, chunking, parsing, entity identification,
			relation extraction, coreference, summarization, etc.) for under-resourced languages.</p>
		<p>
			• Person-centred NLP applications for eHealth including early risk prediction.
		</p>
		<p>
			• Algorithm for Context Data reasoning.
		</p>
		<p>
			• Context sensitive recommendations to individual citizens and patients.
		</p>
		<p>
			• Integration of structured and unstructured resources for health applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			• Domain adaptation techniques for clinical data.
		</p>
		<p>
			• Medical terminologies and ontologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			• Interpretability and analysis of NLP models for healthcare applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			• Processing clinical literature and trial reports.
		</p>
		<p>
			• Bayesian modelling and feature selection techniques for high-dimensional healthcare data.
		</p>
		<p>
			• Multimodal learning for decision support systems: Ubiquitous data, public databases, user generated
			content (in combination with wearable sensor technology).
		</p>
